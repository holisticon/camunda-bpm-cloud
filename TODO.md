Too lazy to write issues ....

Some ideas for later (evtl. not needed if switched to Axon):
* zuul: dynamic routing for engines based on prefixed taskId
  * engine/default/task/complete/simple-12345 -> simple/engine/default/task/complete/simple-12345
* zuul: dynamic registration of process engines based on eureka meta
* (use cloudmqp rabbit node)
