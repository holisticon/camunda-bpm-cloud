## Config Server

The spring cloud config server is our central configuration instance.
It serves yaml/property configs based on application name and active profile.

See link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html[Spring Cloud Config Server] for documentation.

In our environment, we use the link:https://github.com/hyness/spring-cloud-config-server[hyness/spring-cloud-server] Docker image,
which is configured to use the local `configuration` folder as source. Check the `docker-compose.yml`.

When you need to change configs, just modify the files in that directory and the changes are applied
on the next request. No need to rebuild/restart the configserver.
