## Config Server

The spring cloud config server is our central configuration instance.
It serves yaml/property configs based on application name and active profile.

See link:http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/spring-cloud-config.html[Spring Cloud Config Server] for documentation.

In our environment, we use the link:https://github.com/hyness/spring-cloud-config-server[hyness/spring-cloud-server] Docker image,
which is configured to use the `configuration` folder in the github repo as source. Check the `docker-compose.yml`.

When you need to change configs, the easiest way to do so is to edit the files
on github directly, after saving (committing) the changes are available on the config server immediately.
